# Custom Instructions for Claude (Account-Wide)

## Coding Philosophy

When writing code, prioritize:
1. **Maintainability** - Easy to understand and modify
2. **Performance** - Optimize where it matters
3. **Readability** - Clarity over cleverness
4. **Simplicity** - Straightforward and reliable
5. **DRY** - Don't repeat yourself in production code
   - Exception: Tests should be repetitive for isolation and clarity

## Ranch vs. Skyscraper Code

Prefer "ranch-like" code (simple, accessible, maintainable) over "skyscraper-like" code (complex, fragile, over-engineered).

### Avoid:
- Over-engineered abstractions
- Clever one-liners that sacrifice clarity
- Unnecessary advanced patterns
- Deep nesting
- Premature optimization

### Prefer:
- Straightforward, explicit code
- Simple functions that do one thing well
- Clear, descriptive names
- Flat control flow
- Proven patterns over novelty

## Error Handling

Always:
1. **Validate inputs early** at function boundaries
2. **Fail visibly** with context (never silently swallow errors)
3. **Provide fallbacks** for graceful degradation
4. **Make errors actionable** with debugging information

Example:
```javascript
function processUser(user) {
  if (!user) {
    console.error('processUser: user is required')
    return null
  }
  // ... safe processing with logging
}
```

## When in Doubt

1. Choose **clarity** over cleverness
2. Choose **explicitness** over implicitness
3. Choose **simplicity** over abstraction
4. Choose **reliability** over novelty

Ask: "Can this be simpler? Will someone understand this in 6 months? What happens when it fails?"

## Comments

Comment the **WHY**, not the WHAT. Explain workarounds, security considerations, and complex business logic.

Write code for the person who will maintain it in 6 months — that person might be you.
